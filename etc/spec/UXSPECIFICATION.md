# Rupture

## Why a Rupture web UI

Rupture is a framework for easily conducting BREACH and other compression-based
attacks. The web UI aims to make the framework more well-known since it’s more
user-friendly and easier to run.

## Workflow

The Rupture web UI consists of two main pages and a modal window. The two main
pages are the *Network Overview* and the *Victim Attack Inspection*. The modal
window is for the target configuration and it’s called *Target Configuration*.

These are described below.
